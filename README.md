# Sentiment Analysis Model for Indonesian Social Media

This is a capstone project developed as part of the Hacktiv8 program at MSIB. The project aims to create a sentiment analysis model that automatically classifies text in Indonesian into **positive** or **negative** categories, focusing on social media comments. The model has been deployed to **IBM Watson**, making it accessible to others through the IBM API.

---

## Project Goals

The main objective of this project is to build a robust sentiment analysis solution for social media in the Indonesian language. By leveraging **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques, the model provides insights into user sentiment, helping in content moderation and enhancing engagement strategies.

---

## Features

- **Sentiment Classification**: Automatically detects whether a given comment is **positive** or **negative**.
- **Indonesian Language Support**: Tailored specifically for the Indonesian language.
- **IBM Watson Deployment**: The model is deployed to IBM Watson, enabling easy integration and usage through an API key.
- **Open for Collaboration**: Developers and organizations can use the model by acquiring an IBM API key.

---

## Dataset

We utilized a publicly available dataset for Instagram comments:
- **Source**: [Dataset Sentimen Analisis Bahasa Indonesia](https://github.com/rizalespe/Dataset-Sentimen-Analisis-Bahasa-Indonesia/blob/master/dataset_komentar_instagram_cyberbullying.csv)
- The dataset includes annotated comments for training and testing the model.

---

## Tools and Libraries Used

- **TensorFlow**: For building and training the deep learning model.
- **NLTK**: For text preprocessing and tokenization.
- **Sastrawi**: For stemming Indonesian words.

---

## Deployment

The model is hosted on **IBM Watson**. Users can interact with the model through the IBM API by obtaining an API key. This makes the model accessible for integration into various applications, such as social media monitoring tools or sentiment analysis dashboards.

## How to Use

1. **Obtain an IBM API Key**:
   - Contact the team or follow the IBM API guidelines to request an API key.
   
2. **Integrate the API**:
   - Use the provided API endpoint to send text data.
   - The response will include the sentiment classification (positive or negative).

3. **Run Sentiment Analysis**:
   - Feed social media comments or other Indonesian text into the API to get sentiment predictions.

## Project Purpose

Proyek ini bertujuan untuk mengembangkan model analisis sentimen yang dapat mengklasifikasikan komentar Instagram secara otomatis ke dalam kategori positif dan negatif. Dengan memanfaatkan teknik Pemrosesan Bahasa Alami (NLP), kami menyediakan solusi yang membantu dalam:
- Moderasi konten.
- Strategi keterlibatan pengguna yang lebih baik.
- Analisis sentimen pengguna media sosial.

## Future Improvements

- Expand the dataset for broader social media platforms (e.g., Twitter, Facebook).
- Enhance the model to handle neutral sentiments and more granular classifications.
- Develop a front-end interface for non-technical users.
